  # Check that this runs on PHP on all versions we claim to support, on both
  # UNIX-like and Windows environments, and that use both the lowest possible
  # compatible version as well as the most-recent stable version. This will
  # fail-fast by default, so we include our edgiest versions (currently 7.4)
  # first as they're most likely to fail.
