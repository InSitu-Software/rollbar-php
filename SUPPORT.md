## Standard of Care

We respond to every issue, pull request, and discussion post on GitHub. We're
a dedicated team, but do realize we're also a small team. We will respond as
soon as possible.

## Long-Term Support

We strive to support older engine versions, but do eventually end support so
we can focus our effort where it matters: feature development!

Consequently, we adopt the following policy:

* PHP versions having not yet reached end-of-life receive new features and bug
  fixes. Releases are made at semi-regular intervals.
* PHP versions more than two (2) years since end-of-life will receive bug
  fixes only. Releases will be made on an as-needed basis.
* PHP versions more than five (5) years since end-of-life will receive no
  further support: neither bug fixes, new features, nor new releases.

For a complete list of current PHP versions, and when they become unsupported,
consult the [Supported Branches][php-sb] manifest.

approximate date that state becomes active.

<sup>†</sup> This support policy was adopted on 2020-12-31. By this date, PHP
5.6, 5.5, 5.4, and 5.3 had all reached their end date for feature and fixes.
Consequently, we adopt 2020-12-31 as their common end.
