# Need Help?

We're here for you!

* If you have a question, ask in our [Discussion Q&amp;A][q-a]
* To report a bug, raise [an issue][issue]
* For account service, reach out to [support@rollbar.com][support]

## Standard of Care

We respond to every issue, pull request, and discussion post on GitHub. We're
a dedicated team, but do realize we're also a small team. We will respond as
soon as possible.

## Long-Term Support

We strive to support older engine versions, but do eventually cease support
so we can focus our effort where it matters: feature development!

Consequently, we have the following policy:

* PHP versions more than five (5) years since end-of-life will be dropped.
* PHP versions more than two (2) years since end-of-life will receive bug fixes only.

For a list of older PHP versions, and when they reached their end-of-life,
consult the [Unsupported Branches][php-ub] manifest.
